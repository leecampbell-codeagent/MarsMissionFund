# Tech Stack

> **Spec ID:** L3-008
> **Version:** 0.1.0
> **Status:** Approved
> **Rate of change:** Slow (changes at major technology decisions)
> **Depends on:** L1-001, L2-002, L3-001
> **Depended on by:** All L3 and L4 specs (technology baseline)

---

## Purpose

> **Local demo scope**: All technology choices in this document are **real** and used in the local demo. Cloud infrastructure (ECS Fargate, CloudFront, ECR, Terraform Cloud) is replaced by Docker Compose for local development. The local demo uses the same languages, frameworks, and libraries listed here.

This document enumerates the technology choices for the Mars Mission Fund platform.
It serves as the single source of truth for languages, frameworks, libraries, infrastructure, and tooling.
